## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt a new thing in CSS which is calc() function. It's so cool all you need is just a little bit a math.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-position: calc(50vw - 1000px) calc(50vh - 953px), calc(
        50vw - 50px
      ) calc(50vh - 10px);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on calc() function in my future projects. I just have to dig deeper & find out about it more.
